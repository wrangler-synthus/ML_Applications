# Introduction
- This Project is done to demonstrate the use 1D-Convolutions for processing text Data.
- The outcome of this project is to build a classifier that detects whether the comment is toxic or not.
- There is a PDF-File that can help to understand the Usage of 1D-Convolutions and methods like Bag of Words and Embeddings.
- The final result achieved is around ~96% for test accuracy.
- Please, Feel free to try and play around with the code.

# Data-Set
The data set we will use comes from the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) on Kaggle. 
I have added a subset of the model that I have used. Feel free to download it for your use.

- [Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19T2mChGRwCYy3of2mvBi0Wt_pa5ePRNO/view?usp=sharing) Dataset used for validating the model predictions.

- [Train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y1n0avBoTAlIyeSbax6lXPE7nR8VFnOC/view?usp=sharing) Dataset is used for building the model.

# Project Details
- This is one of the series of the project that helps us to understand the methodologies used in Natural Language Processing.
